Guest Lectures	Date: 26th June, 2013
Title: Science Education - Opportunities
Speaker: Prof. V.Nanda Kishore
Content: Science education has taken a back seat due to relatively high number of opportunities in the Information Technology (IT) sector. However the students need to keep in mind that Science based industry is supposed to grow and is expected to be a bigger employment base than the IT sector in a decade or two.  STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) is the primary focus in all advanced countries and they are unable to motivate enough children in these countries to take interest in science.  Those who join service economy, would not be able to move back to science based career later in life unless they do another degree to serve as a launch pad.  So those students with serious interest in science should stay close to their academic interest for the next decade by either getting involved in research or in teaching.
