     <h3> Leadership training:</h3>
<p><b><blink><font color="Fuchsia ">“Training our students to be leaders of tomorrow is at the heart of all our leadership programs”</b></blink> </font></p>
<p>College leadership training is very important especially for the leader who is lucky enough to stand out at the college level. Taking into consideration the fact that the main reason why people are in college is to pursue their studies and not to lead, it is very important that the college leader should be trained in college leadership skills so that they are able to balance the college leadership with the studies in order to avoid the possibility of failing their college exams due to the over-concentration on the college leadership responsibilities. The process of choosing a good place to go for your college leadership training should not be so complicated given the availability of the internet and lots of online training programs.</p> 
<p>It would only take a few minutes over the internet to find the training program that suites your needs. By engaging the internet search engines, you will be able to come up with so many relevant programs relevant to your search, it would then be up to you to narrow down the results by reading more about each program to see if it fits your needs and is convenient for your situation. The cost and the duration of time needed to cover the program would also be favorable given that the college students is likely to be having a regular time table to follow at the campus. Going for another on campus training would be adding more work load to an already tight work schedule. </p>
<p>The online option of training should be the best option for college leadership training since it gives the college student the flexibility to choose when to take the course. The ability to choose your own training time is very good for students who already have other lecture time tables to follow since they can be able to choose their own times even if it is at night once they are through with the regular college work. It is also a good option since some students may not even know that you are taking the courses just in case your rival in the college leadership struggle may also want to counter your moves.</p>
